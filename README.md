Project Euler is a collection of mathematical and programming problems. Each problem is a small brain challenge that allows you to improve your programming skills and find an optimal algorithm for solving the problem. In the current project, you will find a solution to problems in the ABAP language. There are no and will not be ready-made answers to problems, only their solutions.

# The Problems

1. [Multiples of 3 or 5](https://github.com/analiteg/ABAP-Project-Euler/blob/main/01.abap/)
2. [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/analiteg/ABAP-Project-Euler/blob/main/02.abap/)
3. [Largest prime factor](https://github.com/analiteg/ABAP-Project-Euler/blob/main/03.abap/)
