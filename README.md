Project Euler is a collection of mathematical and programming problems. Each problem is a small brain challenge that allows you to improve your programming skills and find an optimal algorithm for solving the problem. In the current project, you will find a solution to problems in the ABAP language. There are no and will not be ready-made answers to problems, only their solutions.
